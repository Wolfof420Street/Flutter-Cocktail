App Listing Cocktails


## 

This project is a simple project showing the use of BLOC in State Management. It Shows a List Of Cocktails From a Public API and Opens A Detail Page On How to Make The Cocktails. The Home Page Also Shows A Random Cocktail Each time the page is reloaded. I am Looking Forward To Improve The User Interface And Add More Features To It.
